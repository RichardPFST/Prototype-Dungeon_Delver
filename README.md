This project is a Unity Example Game from the book [Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development, 2nd Edition](https://book.prototools.net/), by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

It is a classic action-adventure game prototype, inspired by the [The Legend of Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)) game.

## How to play

- Dray has a total of 6 health, shown by the _health balls_ displayed on the panel to the right of the screen.
- Use the _arrow keys_ to move Dray around the dungeon. 
- Press the 'Z' button to attack enemies with your sword, dealing 2 damage to enemies and knocking them back.
- Press the 'X' button to use your grappler weapon, after you pick it up. The _grappler_ deals 1 damage to enemies and pulls Dray towards walls.

If you land on a red tile, after grappling to a wall, your position will be reseted to the last safe location you were in, typically the beggining of the room
you were in, and suffer a health penalty.

If you die, your position will be reseted to the beggining of the dungeon.

## Enemies
The prototype has 2 types of enemies:

- ### Skeletos

</p>

The _Skeletos_ enemy inflicts 1 damage and knocks Dray back, on collision.

- ### Spiker

</p>

The _Spiker_ enemy senses Dray, and when he is near a Spiker, it will charge at him in a single direction.

It deals 1 damage and also knocks Dray back.

## Items
Along the dungeon you will find items laying around or you will kill monsters that will drop them.

These items can be:

- A key, which opens locked doors in the dungeon;
